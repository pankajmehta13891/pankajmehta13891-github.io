Welcome to AIML Iris Dashboard Project  Welcome to this repository created for Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AIML) training and practice at NIELT Ropar. This project serves as a hands-on learning platform for exploring data analytics, visualization, and machine learning concepts
This repository contains practical implementations, experiments, and mini projects developed as part of AIML learning activities.

The primary focus is to demonstrate real-world applications of:
Data visualization and dashboard development
Statistical analysis using Python libraries
Machine learning model implementation
Dataset exploration and feature analysis
Web-based and desktop-based data applications
The project showcases an interactive Iris Dataset Mini Dashboard, designed to help understand classification behavior and feature relationships in a structured and user-friendly manner.
